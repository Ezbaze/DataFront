## ‚ú® Future Features
*   **Custom Table Views**: Design and build your own unique data tables tailored to your strategic needs. You will be able to select which data points appear in each column, from player stats to ship details. For truly advanced analysis, you can create calculated columns using your own JavaScript code to compute custom metrics, scores, or ratios for every row in the table.
*   **Saving/Imports/Exports**: You will be able to save your entire personalized sidebar configuration, including your custom panel layouts, created actions, and unique table views. This feature will allow you to export your setup to a file, making it simple to back up your work or transfer your environment to another computer. Furthermore, you can share these exports with teammates, allowing your entire clan to quickly adopt powerful, standardized strategic tools and layouts.
*   **Notes/Tags for Clans/Username/UserID**: Attach custom notes and strategic tags to players, clans, or user IDs, creating a persistent intelligence file on your opponents and allies. You can mark a clan as an 'early aggressor' or a player as a 'reliable trader', and this information will be fully integrated with the scripting engine, enabling your actions to trigger custom events and alerts. For example, you could automatically receive a warning in your logs the moment a clan you've tagged as a 'rival' appears in your game.
*   **Enhanced Log Interactivity**: The Log view will become even more interactive, allowing you to click on various in-game entities mentioned in log messages. This expansion will include the ability to click on specific buildings like Missile Silos, individual ship types such as Transports or Warships, and raw map coordinates. Clicking these elements will instantly focus your map view on their precise location, providing immediate context for alerts and making it faster than ever to react to events reported by your custom actions.
